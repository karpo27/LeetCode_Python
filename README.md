# LeetCode Python

![Badge en Desarollo](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20DEVELOPMENT-green)

In this repository you will find several problemas and solutions from my Python track in LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/)

My public profile: https://leetcode.com/karpo27/

You have the problems divided in 3 categories as follows: Easy, Medium, Hard

Inside each category every problem folder has a:

1- "Instructions" file (.md), wich contains the statements for the exercise.

2- "Solution" file (.py), wich contains one of the possible solutions (yes! there are many ways to solve the exercises)

In order to make the code work LeetCode created several tests for each problem. This tests assign values to arguments and expect a value. That is why you'll not see in "Solution" file the call to functions or classes.
